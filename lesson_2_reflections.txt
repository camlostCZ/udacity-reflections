1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory gets created, metadata initialized.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows you to include only a subset of files from the working directory.
Which makes possible to make smaller, better commits.
