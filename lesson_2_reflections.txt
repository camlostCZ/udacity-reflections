5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

well, they do visualize it.

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A single branch witch changes introduced in the merged branches.
As the changes 'join' together. The merged branch can be deleted, by the way.

7. What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Manual work is rather tedious and prone to mistakes so it makes sense to let computer, i.e. git, do what can be done automatically.
